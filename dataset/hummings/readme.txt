Here must go the humming query files that can be obtained from http://mtg.upf.edu/download/datasets/MTG-QBH

The files must be renamed to match the names of their target songs. If there is more than one query for the same song, then they must have a +N suffix.

Example:
- Aretha Franklin - You Make Me Feel Like A Natural Woman.wav
- Aretha Franklin - You Make Me Feel Like A Natural Woman+2.wav
